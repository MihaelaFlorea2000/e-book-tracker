# E-book Reading Tracker

An E-book reading tracking application. 

Nowadays, people’s habits are changing as they tend to incorporate technology into more aspects of their everyday lives. When it comes to reading, a lot of users switched to ebooks and e-content, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the popularity of fitness devices has increased peoples’ interest in self-tracking as a means of recording or improving various habits.

However, despite this growing interest in e-reading and self-tracking, there are currently limited automatic solutions for users to keep track of their reading progress over time. Therefore, this platform aims to improve the readers’ experience by combining e-reading, tracking and social networking features.
